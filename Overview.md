MasterCopy
==========

[MasterCopy](index.html) is a free, open source web app
for artists who use digital projectors
to transfer their work to canvas.

If you've ever used a digital projector to transfer
artwork, you know it's _really_ hard to get the image aligned with the canvas.
It doesn’t matter whether you move the projector or you move the canvas - 
either way you’re going to be spending some time.

MasterCopy takes a different approach - 
instead of you moving the projector or the canvas, MasterCopy moves the image.
All you have to do is use the mouse to drag the corners in place.
